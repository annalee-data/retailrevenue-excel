## 1. Business Problem
- Retail company needs to forecast sales, costs, and profit for next year.
- Management wants to know how different sales growth scenarios (best, base, worst) affect profit.

Goal: Support strategic planning with data-driven insights.

## 2. Dataset
- 12 months of historical sales & cost data from 2023.
- Variables include:
    - Sales by product category (Electronics, Clothing, Grocery).
    - Fixed Costs (rent, utilities, etc.).
    - Variable Costs (based on sales).
    - Staffing Costs (salaries, wages).
- Source: Dummy dataset created by me.

## 3. Methodology
- Profit Caclulation: Revenue - Total Costs.
- Forecasting:
- Scenario Analysis:
    - Best Case: 10% sales growth
    - Base Case: 5% sales growth
    - Worst Case: -5% sales growth
- Visualization:
    - Bar Chart -> Total Sales by Month
    - Pie Chart -> Sales Share by Product Category
    - Scenario Summary -> Scenario comparison
